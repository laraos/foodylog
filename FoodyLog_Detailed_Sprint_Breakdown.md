# FoodyLog - Detailed Sprint Breakdown

_Version 2.0 - August 2025_

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint Overview

This document provides detailed breakdowns for each sprint in the FoodyLog development timeline, including specific tasks, time estimates, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.

### Estimation Guidelines

- **Story Points**: Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- **1 Story Point** â‰ˆ 1 hour of development work
- **Sprint Capacity**: 50 story points per 2-week sprint (solo developer)
- **Buffer**: 30% buffer for meetings, context switching, and interruptions

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Authentication: Clerk Pre-built Components**
- Decision: Use Clerk's pre-built SignIn/SignUp components instead of custom forms
- Rationale: Faster development, better security, built-in accessibility, less maintenance
- Impact: Reduced authentication epic from 25 to 13 story points
- Trade-off: Less UI customization for faster, more reliable implementation
