# Story 1.3.4: Protected Routes & Session Management - Implementation Notes

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Overview
Successfully implemented protected routes and session management using Clerk's built-in components as specified in the FoodyLog Sprint 1 requirements.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Updated ProtectedRoute Component (`src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used custom `useAuth` hook with manual authentication checking
- **After**: Uses Clerk's built-in `SignedIn`/`SignedOut` components and `useAuth` hook
- **Benefits**: 
  - More reliable authentication state management
  - Automatic session persistence
  - Better error handling
  - Less maintenance overhead

#### 2. Enhanced Clerk Configuration (`src/lib/auth/clerk.ts`)
- Added proper redirect URL configuration
- Implemented session management helpers
- Added deep linking support utilities
- Created route protection configuration

#### 3. Created Authentication Test Page (`src/components/auth/AuthTestPage.tsx`)
- Comprehensive testing interface for authentication flows
- Real-time authentication state display
- Deep linking test functionality
- Session persistence verification tools

#### 4. Added Route Configuration
- Added `/auth-test` route to App.tsx for testing protected routes
- Integrated test page with existing layout system

#### 5. Created Unit Tests (`src/components/auth/__tests__/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`)
- Tests for ProtectedRoute component behavior
- Tests for PublicRoute component behavior
- Mocked Clerk components for reliable testing

### Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Unauthenticated users redirected to Clerk SignIn**
- Implemented using `SignedOut` component with `Navigate` to `/auth/sign-in`
- Preserves intended destination in location state

✅ **Authenticated users can access protected routes**
- Implemented using `SignedIn` component to wrap protected content
- Automatic rendering when user authentication is confirmed

✅ **Session persistence works across app restarts**
- Handled automatically by Clerk's session management
- No custom session storage required

✅ **Loading states show during auth checks**
- Uses Clerk's `isLoaded` state for loading indicators
- Custom fallback components supported

✅ **Deep linking works after authentication**
- Implemented redirect preservation using React Router's location state
- Added helper utilities for deep link management
- Test page includes deep linking verification tools

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Clerk Integration Approach
```typescript
// Uses Clerk's built-in components for reliable state management
<SignedIn>
  {children}
</SignedIn>
<SignedOut>
  <Navigate to={redirectTo} state={{ from: location }} replace />
</SignedOut>
```

#### Session Management
- Leverages Clerk's automatic session persistence
- No manual token management required
- Automatic session refresh handled by Clerk

#### Deep Linking Support
- Location state preservation for post-auth redirects
- Session storage fallback for complex navigation flows
- URL parameter support for external deep links

### Testing Strategy

#### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/auth-test` when authenticated to see test interface
2. Sign out and verify redirect to sign-in page
3. Sign back in and verify redirect to intended destination
4. Test deep linking using the test page buttons
5. Refresh page to verify session persistence

#### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for component behavior
- Mocked Clerk components for predictable testing
- Coverage for both authenticated and unauthenticated states

### Performance Considerations

#### Optimizations Made
- Uses Clerk's optimized authentication state management
- Minimal re-renders through proper component structure

- Deep linking support for mobile app launches

### Future Enhancements

#### Potential Improvements
1. Add role-based route protection
2. Implement route-specific loading states
3. Add analytics for authentication flows
4. Enhanced error handling for network issues

### Dependencies

#### Required Packages
- `@clerk/clerk-react` (already installed)
- `react-router-dom` (already installed)
- No additional dependencies required

### Configuration Requirements

#### Environment Variables
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` must be set
- Clerk dashboard configuration for redirect URLs

#### Clerk Dashboard Settings
- Sign-in URL: `/auth/sign-in`
- Sign-up URL: `/auth/sign-up`
- After sign-in URL: `/meals`
- After sign-up URL: `/meals`

### Story Points Delivered
- **Estimated**: 2 points (simplified with Clerk pre-built components)
- **Actual**: 2 points
- **Complexity**: Low (leveraging Clerk's built-in functionality)

### Next Steps
1. Test on mobile devices with Capacitor
2. Verify Clerk dashboard configuration
3. Monitor authentication flows in production
4. Consider adding role-based permissions in future sprints

# Accessibility Testing Framework - Implementation Notes

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive accessibility testing utilities to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all FoodyLog components. The framework provides automated testing for keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus management, and color contrast.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Accessibility Testing Utilities (`src/test/accessibility.ts`)
- **axe-core Configuration**: Custom configuration for FoodyLog's design system
- **Keyboard Navigation Testing**: Automated testing of tab order and keyboard accessibility
- **Focus Management Testing**: Modal and dialog focus trap verification
- **Screen Reader Testing**: ARIA implementation and announcement verification
- **Color Contrast Testing**: WCAG AA compliance verification
- **Mock Screen Reader**: Testing utilities for screen reader interactions

#### 2. Core Testing Functions

##### `testAccessibility(renderResult, options)`
Comprehensive test suite that runs all accessibility checks:
```typescript
await testAccessibility(renderResult, {
  expectedFocusableElements: 2,
  expectedAriaLive: ['polite'],
  skipColorContrast: false,
  skipKeyboardNavigation: false
});
```

##### `testKeyboardNavigation(renderResult, expectedElements)`
Tests keyboard navigation through interactive elements:
```typescript
const focusableElements = await testKeyboardNavigation(renderResult, 5);
```

##### `testFocusTrap(renderResult, triggerSelector, modalSelector)`
Tests focus management for modals and dialogs:
```typescript
await testFocusTrap(renderResult, '[data-testid="trigger"]', '[role="dialog"]');
```

##### `testScreenReaderAnnouncements(renderResult, expectedAriaLive)`
Verifies screen reader support and ARIA implementation:
```typescript
testScreenReaderAnnouncements(renderResult, ['polite', 'assertive']);
```

##### `testColorContrast(renderResult)`
Tests color contrast compliance for WCAG AA standards:
```typescript
const results = await testColorContrast(renderResult);
```

#### 3. Mock Screen Reader Implementation
Provides testing utilities for screen reader interactions:
```typescript
mockScreenReader.announce('Meal saved successfully');
expect(mockScreenReader.getLastAnnouncement()).toBe('Meal saved successfully');
```

### Configuration Details

#### axe-core Configuration
Custom configuration optimized for FoodyLog:
- **Enabled Rules**: Critical for food logging workflow (color-contrast, aria-allowed-attr, button-name, form-field-multiple-labels, label)
- **Disabled Rules**: Rules that conflict with shadcn/ui patterns (landmark-one-main, region, page-has-heading-one)
- **Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (wcag2a, wcag2aa, wcag21aa tags)

#### Test Environment Setup
- **jest-axe Integration**: Extended expect matchers for accessibility testing
- **JSDOM Limitations**: Color contrast testing skipped in test environment
- **Mock Implementations**: Screen reader and browser API mocks

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Component Test
```typescript
test('Component accessibility compliance', async () => {
  const renderResult = render(<YourComponent />);
  await testAccessibility(renderResult, {
    expectedFocusableElements: 2,
  });
});
```

#### Form Component Test
```typescript
test('Form accessibility compliance', async () => {
  const renderResult = render(<MealForm />);
  await testAccessibility(renderResult, {
    expectedFocusableElements: 6,
    expectedAriaLive: ['polite'],
  });
});
```

#### Modal Focus Management Test
```typescript
test('Modal focus management', async () => {
  const renderResult = render(<MealEditDialog />);
  await testFocusTrap(
    renderResult,
    '[data-testid="edit-button"]',
    '[role="dialog"]'
  );
});
```
