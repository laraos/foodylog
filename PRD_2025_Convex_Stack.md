# FoodyLog - Product Requirements Document (2025)

_Version 2.0 - August 2025_

## üìã Executive Summary

FoodyLog is a mobile-first food logging application that enables users to quickly capture, organize, and analyze their dining experiences. The app focuses on simplicity, offline-first functionality, and personal food journey tracking with optional social features. Delivery assumption: MVP executed by a solo developer, with selective contractor support for design/QA.

### Vision Statement

_"The simplest way to remember every meal that matters"_

### Mission

To help food enthusiasts create a comprehensive, personal record of their culinary experiences while providing insights into their eating patterns, preferences, and spending habits.

## üéØ Product Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Effortless Meal Logging**: Enable users to log meals in under 30 seconds
2. **Offline-First Experience**: Work seamlessly without internet connectivity
3. **Personal Insights**: Provide meaningful analytics about eating patterns
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Native mobile (Capacitor) and Web PWA from a single SPA codebase

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Quickstart (Bun)

```bash
bun install
bun run dev

# Mobile (first time)
bunx cap add android
# bunx cap add ios

# Sync and run
bunx cap sync
bunx cap run android
```

## üîÅ Live Reload on Device (Capacitor)

```bash
# .env.example
# Android Emulator
CAP_SERVER_URL=http://10.0.2.2:5173
# Physical device (replace with your PC IP)
# CAP_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.123:5173
```

Run Vite with LAN host (already in scripts): `bun run dev`. Then: `bunx cap run android --no-sync`.

## üì¶ PWA Details

- Manifest: name/short_name/start_url/display/icons (192/512 PNG + maskable) and `apple-touch-icon` (180x180).
- Service worker: `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` and in-app update toast.
- Audits: Lighthouse PWA checks (installable, offline-capable, HTTPS).

## ü§ñ CI Improvements (Bun)

- Use `oven-sh/setup-bun@v1`, `bun install`, caching Bun cache, `bun run build`.
- Mobile builds with `bunx cap build android` and artifact upload.
- Convex deploy with `bunx convex deploy` (use secrets).
- Concurrency to cancel stale runs:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

## üßæ Documentation Hygiene

- Prefer Bun commands in docs; commit `bun.lockb` only (no `package-lock.json`).
- Keep `.env.example` updated:

```bash
VITE_CONVEX_URL=
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
VITE_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=
CAP_SERVER_URL=
```

// User -> Followers/Following (many-to-many through follows)
// Meal -> Photos (one-to-many)
// Meal -> Place (many-to-one)
// Meal -> Likes/Comments (one-to-many)
// Place -> Meals (one-to-many)

// Recommended Convex indexes:
// - meals: by userId, by dateEaten, by isPublic, by rating
// - mealPhotos: by mealId, by isPrimary, by userId (for storage quota)
// - places: by coordinates (for location search), by city, by cuisine
// - follows: by followerId, by followingId

// - mealComments: by mealId, by userId, by isReported
// - budgets: by userId, by isActive, by period
// - userStorageQuota: by userId
// - contentReports: by status, by contentType
// - mealSearchIndex: by searchText (full-text), by userId, by dateEaten
```
