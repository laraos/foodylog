# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational infrastructure for FoodyLog, a mobile-first food logging application. The project setup includes creating a React + TypeScript SPA with Vite, configuring Capacitor 7 for mobile deployment, setting up Convex backend, and establishing CI/CD pipeline. This infrastructure enables rapid development of the core meal logging features while ensuring cross-platform compatibility and modern development practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured React+TS SPA with Vite and PWA capabilities so that I can build a modern, performant application that works offline and can be installed on devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a Vite project with React + TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN react-router-dom is configured THEN the system SHALL support SPA routing with proper navigation
3. WHEN the TypeScript configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL enforce strict mode for type safety
4. WHEN the development server runs THEN the system SHALL provide hot reload functionality for both web and Capacitor
5. WHEN error boundaries are implemented THEN the system SHALL catch and display errors gracefully without crashing
6. WHEN PWA configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL pass Lighthouse PWA checks and work offline with cached shell
7. WHEN the service worker is registered THEN the system SHALL provide automatic updates with user notification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Capacitor 7 configured for iOS and Android so that the web application can run natively on mobile devices with access to device features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Capacitor 7 is installed THEN the system SHALL configure iOS and Android projects successfully
2. WHEN capacitor.config.ts is configured THEN the system SHALL specify correct app details and webDir settings
3. WHEN the app launches on iOS simulator THEN the system SHALL display without errors and support basic navigation
4. WHEN the app launches on Android emulator THEN the system SHALL display without errors and support basic navigation
5. WHEN live reload is configured THEN the system SHALL update the mobile app automatically during development
6. WHEN mobile navigation is tested THEN the system SHALL respond to touch interactions appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Convex backend configured so that I can store and sync data with real-time capabilities and serverless functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Convex project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create proper backend structure with schema
2. WHEN Convex client is configured THEN the system SHALL connect successfully to the backend
3. WHEN basic query/mutation is tested THEN the system SHALL execute database operations correctly
4. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL separate development and production environments
5. WHEN real-time subscriptions are tested THEN the system SHALL update UI automatically when data changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipeline so that code quality is maintained, tests run automatically, and deployment is streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Actions workflow is configured THEN the system SHALL use Bun for package management and builds
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run automated tests and prevent merging on failure
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL enforce ESLint and Prettier formatting rules
4. WHEN builds are triggered THEN the system SHALL succeed for web, iOS, and Android platforms
5. WHEN deployment is configured THEN the system SHALL deploy to staging environment automatically
6. WHEN environment secrets are configured THEN the system SHALL securely manage API keys and credentials
