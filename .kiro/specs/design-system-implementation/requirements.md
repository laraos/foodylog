# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Design System Implementation feature establishes a comprehensive, consistent, and accessible design foundation for FoodyLog. This system will provide reusable UI components, theming capabilities, and layout structures that ensure visual consistency across the entire application while supporting both light and dark modes. The design system must be mobile-first, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant), and optimized for the food logging use case.

This implementation directly supports FoodyLog's vision of "The simplest way to remember every meal that matters" by providing intuitive, beautiful interfaces that make meal logging effortless and enjoyable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured shadcn/ui design system with FoodyLog's custom theme, so that all components follow consistent visual design and branding.

2. WHEN a user toggles between light and dark modes THEN all components SHALL update their appearance seamlessly
3. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL use the custom theme colors, typography, and spacing defined in the design system
4. WHEN CSS custom properties are defined THEN they SHALL support dynamic theming and be accessible via Tailwind CSS classes
5. IF a component uses the design system THEN it SHALL automatically inherit proper contrast ratios meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
6. WHEN the design system is documented THEN it SHALL include examples of all color variants, typography scales, and spacing tokens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want essential UI components built with consistent styling and behavior, so that I can create cohesive interfaces throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN Loading and Error states are shown THEN they SHALL be visually consistent and provide clear feedback to users
6. IF any component receives focus THEN it SHALL display clear focus indicators that meet accessibility standards
7. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL work correctly on both touch and mouse interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation and layout throughout the app, so that I can easily move between sections and understand the interface structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main layout is rendered THEN it SHALL provide consistent header, content area, and navigation structure
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the bottom navigation SHALL be easily accessible and show clear active states
3. WHEN page transitions occur THEN they SHALL be smooth, accessible, and provide appropriate loading feedback
4. WHEN the header is displayed THEN it SHALL include user menu access and contextual actions based on the current page
5. WHEN safe areas are present on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL handle them properly without content overlap
6. IF navigation is accessed via keyboard THEN all navigation elements SHALL be reachable and operable
7. WHEN screen readers are used THEN navigation SHALL provide proper landmarks and announcements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want all design system components to be fully accessible, so that I can use FoodyLog effectively regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component is rendered THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
2. WHEN color is used to convey information THEN it SHALL be accompanied by additional visual or textual indicators
3. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN they SHALL have minimum touch target sizes of 44x44 pixels
4. WHEN form controls are used THEN they SHALL have proper labels, descriptions, and error associations
5. IF focus moves between elements THEN the focus order SHALL be logical and predictable
6. WHEN screen readers are used THEN all components SHALL provide appropriate semantic markup and ARIA attributes
7. WHEN users navigate via keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable and operable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples for the design system, so that I can implement consistent interfaces efficiently and onboard new team members easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the design system is documented THEN it SHALL include live examples of all components with their variants
2. WHEN component documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL show usage guidelines, props, and accessibility considerations
3. WHEN design tokens are documented THEN they SHALL include color palettes, typography scales, spacing values, and breakpoints
4. WHEN implementation examples are provided THEN they SHALL show both basic usage and advanced patterns
5. IF a component has specific usage guidelines THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with do's and don'ts
6. WHEN the documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the current state of all components and design tokens
7. WHEN developers reference the documentation THEN they SHALL find clear guidance for implementing accessible, consistent interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a FoodyLog user, I want the design system to reflect the food-focused nature of the app, so that the interface feels purposeful and aligned with my meal logging activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the color palette is applied THEN it SHALL evoke appetite, warmth, and food-related emotions while maintaining professional appearance
